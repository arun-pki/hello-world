        <H2 class="Heading2">Adding Structures to a Dictionary</H2>
        <DIV class="Body">You can create your own personal library of structures or compounds that you frequently use. You enter a short name or acronym that represents the structure so you can easily insert it in future chemical drawings. When you invoke the new structure name, ChemDraw draws the structure in your drawing area.</DIV>
        <DIV class="Body">For example, you might create a structure to add to the dictionary for a new, not yet approved drug you are working on. Once you create the structure, the dictionary keeps the structure name and its SMILES string.</DIV>
        <DIV class="Body">To add a new structure to the dictionary:</DIV>
        <DIV class="numlist1-1st" MadCap:autonum="1. ">Draw the "xyz" structure, where "xyz" is your new frequently used structure.</DIV>
        <DIV class="numlist1-inner" MadCap:autonum="2. ">Select the structure and navigate to <b>Structure&gt;Add Structure to Dictionary</b>.</DIV>
        <DIV class="numlist1-last" MadCap:autonum="3. ">Enter a short name or acronym for your structure, and then click <b>Save</b>.</DIV>
        <DIV class="Body">When you select <b>Structure&gt;Convert Name to Structure</b> and enter your new structure short name, the structure displays in the drawing area with the new structure name as a caption.</DIV>
