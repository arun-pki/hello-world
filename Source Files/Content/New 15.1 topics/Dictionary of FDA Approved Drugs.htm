        <H3 class="Heading3">Dictionary of FDA Approved Drugs</H3>
        <DIV class="Body">ChemDraw contains a dictionary of FDA approved drugs and their structures for the years 2009 to 2015. The dictionary will be updated on an annual basis. When you search for structures using <b>Structure&gt;Convert Name to Structure</b>, ChemDraw will first attempt to use its internal name to structure capability to create the structure. If unsuccessful it will check the FDA dictionary and again, if unsuccessful the user defined dictionary.  This process is very rapid and will be invisible to the user. If the search is still unsuccessful and the user has an internet connection, it will search the online ChemACX database's synonym table to try to match the input name. If still unsuccessful, or if more than one ChemACX entry matched the name provided, a message displays with the results of the search.</DIV>
