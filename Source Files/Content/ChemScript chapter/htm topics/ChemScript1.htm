        <div class="Body">ChemScript is the cheminformatics Software Development Kit (SDK). It contains the programming algorithms that are common throughout PerkinElmer products. As a software developer, you can apply ChemScript to create your own scripts to use with ChemOffice applications.</div>
        <div class="Body">All example script files in the ChemScript library are available in <MadCap:keyword term="Python" />Python and <MadCap:keyword term=".NET" />C#/.NET. If you are familiar with either of these languages, you will find these scripts easy to understand. However, if you are new to either Python or C#/.NET, we suggest that you refer to the Web sites and books listed at the end of this chapter.</div>
        <div class="Body">Although ChemScript is available in Python and C#/.NET, we will use Python in this guide to explain ChemScript. <MadCap:keyword term="Python" />Python is a non-proprietary and widely used programming language.</div>
