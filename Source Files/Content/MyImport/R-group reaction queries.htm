        <H3 class="Heading3">R-group reaction queries</H3>
        <DIV class="Body">You can search and store reactions. In a reaction, one or several compounds (reactants) are transformed into other compounds (products). Individual reactants (or products) are separated from each other with plus signs. The reactants are separated from the products with an arrow.</DIV>
        <DIV class="Body">You can also search for chemical reactions containing r-groups. An example of a chemical reaction containing r-groups is shown below:</DIV>
        <DIV class="Body">
            <img src="r-group reaction.png" />
        </DIV>
        <H4 class="Heading4">Searching for reactants</H4>
        <DIV class="Body"> Searching for reactants is useful if you have a known starting material and you are interested in learning more about what substances it can produce. A reactants query is very similar to a reaction search, except that there is nothing to the right of the arrow. For example, consider the query:</DIV>
        <DIV class="Body">
            <img src="reactant query.png" />
        </DIV>
        <p class="Caption">Sample r-group reactant query</p>
        <DIV class="Body">A likely hit for the above query is shown below:</DIV>
        <DIV class="Body">
            <img src="reactant result.png" />
        </DIV>
        <H4 class="Heading4">Searching for products</H4>
        <DIV class="Body"> If you know the desired end product but not how to get there, you can do a products query. A products query is similar to a reaction search, except that there is nothing to the left of the arrow. For example, consider the query:</DIV>
        <DIV class="Body">
            <img src="product query.png" />
        </DIV>
        <p class="Caption">Sample r-group product query</p>
