        <div class="Body">A fragmentation line consists of one or more straight lines that overlap bonds in a structure. These lines are visual aids only, and do not break bonds within the structure.</div>
        <div class="Body">To draw a fragmentation line, click <span class="Action_Object">Mass Spec Analysis tool</span> on the Fragmentation toolbar and drag. To stop drawing, release the mouse button. </div>

        <div class="Body">To reposition one of the vertices of a line segment, press <span class="Action_Object">SHIFT</span>  and move the cursor over the line vertex and drag the vertex to the desired location.</div>
        <div class="Note" MadCap:autonum=" &lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt; "> By default,  fragmentation lines appear  red. To change the color, select the object and choose a color from the Color menu.</div>
        <div class="Body">Fragmentation lines are grouped with the structure that they intersect. When you double-click an atom or bond with the Lasso selection tool, the fragmentation lines are also selected. This lets you rotate or translate the fragmentation lines with their associated structure. However, they can also be selected and moved independently. </div>
        <div class="Body">By default, hovering over an atom or bond highlights the smallest fragment that contains the atom or bond, and the formula, exact mass, and mass of isotopes of significant abundance for each of two fragments are displayed. However, you can press the TAB key to iteratively select successively larger fragments. </div>
