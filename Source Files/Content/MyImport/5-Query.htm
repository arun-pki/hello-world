        <div class="Body">A query is a search for information that is stored in a database. If you have ever searched the Internet using a Web browser, then you have performed a simple query. </div>
        <div class="Body">A query structure is a parameter you use to search a chemical database (the database must include structures for the query to be useful). The query structure can include bond and atom properties that you specify to narrow or broaden the list of search results. Below are two query structure examples:</div>
        <p class="GraphicAnchor">&#160;</p>

            <img src="13_17.jpg" style="width: 180.9994px;height: 135.9994px;margin-left: 2.25px;margin-top: 3.25152px;margin-right: 2.25px;margin-bottom: 2.748961px;" />
        </p>
        <p class="Caption1"><a name="5-Query_617691554_73284"></a>Two example structure queries. A) The results include any connected atom at the location specified by ‘R’; B) The results include either a single or double bond at the location specified by ‘S/D’.</p>
        <div class="Body">To perform a query, you first draw the query structure in ChemDraw. You then enter the structure in a database application such as <MadCap:keyword term="ChemBioFinder" />ChemFinder. The application searches one or more databases that you specify and returns the query results.</div>

            <MadCap:keyword term="limitations, search" />Search Limitations</H2>
        <div class="Body">Several factors determine the search results that are returned. To get the results you expect, you must first ensure that the structure you draw accurately represents the query you want to perform. For example, if your query structure requires that no carbon atoms in an aromatic structure can be part of any ring, you are likely to return no results or an error, depending on the query system used. </div>
        <div class="Body">The search application you use can also affect your query. If the application does not accurately interpret your query structure, or the structures in the database, you could receive inaccurate results.</div>
