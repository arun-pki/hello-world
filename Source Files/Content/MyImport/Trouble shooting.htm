        <H3 class="Heading3">Troubleshooting</H3>
        <DIV class="Body">This section describes steps you can take that affect the overall performance of CS Desktop Applications, as well as steps to follow if your computer crashes when using a CS software product.</DIV>
        <H4 class="Heading4">Performance</H4>
        <DIV class="Body">Below are some ways you can optimize the performance of ChemOffice Desktop Applications:</DIV>
        <DIV class="Bullet1-1st">From the Performance tab in the System control panel, allocate more processor time to the application.</DIV>
        <DIV class="Bullet1-inner">Install more physical RAM. The more you have, the less ChemOffice desktop applications will have to access your hard disk to use Virtual Memory.</DIV>
        <DIV class="Bullet1-inner">Increase the Virtual Memory (VM). Virtual memory extends RAM by allowing space on your hard disk to be used as RAM. However, the time for swapping between the application and the hard disk is slower than swapping with physical RAM.</DIV>
        <H4 class="Heading4">Applications and Drivers</H4>
        <DIV class="Body">As with most complex software applications, there may be unusual circumstances in which ChemDraw may become unresponsive. Below are some recommended steps for you to follow to try to resolve software and driver issues.</DIV>
        <ol>
            <li style="font-family: Arial;"> Restart Windows and try to reproduce the problem. If the problem recurs, continue with the following steps.</li>
            <li style="font-family: Arial;">The most common conflicts concern video drivers, printer drivers, screen savers, and virus protection. If you do need to contact us, be sure to determine what type and version of drivers you are using.</li>
        </ol>
        <DIV class="Bullet1-1st"><b>Video Driver-related issues</b>: If you experience problems displaying any ChemOffice Desktop Application, first try switching to the VGA video driver in the display Control Panel or System Setup, and then retest the issues. If using a different driver helps, your original driver may need to be updated–contact the maker of the driver and obtain the most up-to-date driver. If you still encounter problems, contact us with the relevant details about the original driver and the resulting problem.</DIV>
        <DIV class="Bullet1-inner"><b>Printer Driver-related issues</b>: Try using a different printer driver. If using a different driver helps, your original driver may need to be updated–contact the maker of the driver and obtain the most up-to-date driver. If you still encounter problems, contact us with the relevant details about the original driver and the resulting problem.</DIV>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li style="font-family: Arial;">Reinstall the software. Before you reinstall, uninstall the software, and disable all background applications, including screen savers, and virus protection. Read complete uninstall instructions on the Technical Support web page.</li>
            <li style="font-family: Arial;"> If the problem still persists, use our online <a href="http://www.cambridgesoft.com/contact/support/form/" target="_blank">contact form</a> to provide details to Technical Support.</li>
