        <DIV class="Body">You can undo the last action you performed using the Undo (CTRL+Z) feature. The Redo (CTRL+Y) feature provides a quick way to re-apply changes to your ChemOffice spreadsheet that you removed with the Undo feature. ChemDraw/Excel supports multiple undo/redo operations but due to a limitation in Microsoft Excel only a single operation is visible in Excel's undo/redo list at any given time. </DIV>
        <DIV class="Body">Undo/Redo operations only work for the following commands:</DIV>
        <DIV class="Bullet1-1st">Add/Load/Paste/Delete Molecule</DIV>
        <DIV class="Bullet1-inner">Convert Operations</DIV>
        <DIV class="Bullet1-last">Sort</DIV>
