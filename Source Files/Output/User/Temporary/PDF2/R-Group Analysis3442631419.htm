        <div class="Body">An R-group analysis returns all molecules in the query database that include a template structure that you provide. For example, assume you want to find all molecules  that include toluene in its structure, such as p-cresol or o-xylene (assuming your database includes these molecules). Simply draw toluene as your template and the analysis will return all molecules that contain at least one toluene structure.</div>
        <div class="Body">To illustrate, assume that you have a small database comprising of four molecules: o-, m-, and p-cresol, and bromobenzene. Further assume you want to run an R-group analysis on this database to find all molecules that contain toluene in its structure. You will find that the results include three main parts:</div>
        <div class="Bullet1-1st">The list of molecules that contain the toluene template. In this example, the results include o-, m-, and p-cresol. Bromobenzene is not included because it does not contain the template.</div>
        <div class="Bullet1-1st">The toluene template with all variations of R-group attachments that were found in the database. In this example, the attachments are represented by functional groups. These are the locations of the R-groups found in the analysis results; the hydroxyl groups for o-, m-, and p-cresol.</div>

        <div class="Bullet1-1st">The functional group found at each R<span class="subscript">n</span> position for each search result. For a given returned molecule, look across its row to view the functional group at each R-group position. In this example, the search results consist of a hydrogen and hydroxyl group for R<span class="subscript">1</span>, R<span class="subscript">2</span>, and R<span class="subscript">3</span>.</div>
